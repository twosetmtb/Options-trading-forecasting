This script takes the input of 2 different options contracts (one call and one put) that are at the current trading price and looks at the break even at expiration (BE@EX) and calculates if the stock should be long and short.

Add in the portfolio value to get an estimate of what the allocation to each different stock should have in dollar value.

The win Prob (%) is just an estimate as I don't have a better way to estimate the Win rate.
